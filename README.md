# Hydrodynamics Overview

This contains the links to the materials that we are using in our
Nuclear Astro group hydrodynamics overview.

## General notes:

We'll follow my notes from my [Introduction Computational Astrophysical Hydrodynamics](https://github.com/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf/numerical_exercises) notes


## Advection:

  * Slides: 
    * [advection.pdf](https://github.com/sbu-nuclear-astro/hydro_overview/blob/master/advection.pdf) : slides shown during discussion

  * Sample codes:

    * [fdadvect.py](https://github.com/zingale/hydro_examples/blob/master/advection/fdadvect.py) : a simple first order finite-difference advection code
